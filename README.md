**GELLI** \ˈgel-ē\ ● *proper noun* — *fr. "Generic Embedded Local Llama Interface" — That’s what the acronym stands for this week... ● occasionally faux Italian “gellici,” origin debated, purpose not.*

1. The lean readable toolbox for wrangling AI models without the Amazon rainforest in tow...
2. Especially for AI in contrained spacces. Less about large lange models and more about  LoRAs

### This is a kit for those who loathe Python environments, their dependency dramas, and the emotional toll of debugging pip’s heartbreak. Compile, quantize, bake, and export any AI artifact with the casual flair of a caffeinated shell wizard. There are gotchas (there always are), but nothing like a surprise `pip uninstall torch` at 4am. GELLI generates GGUF, not drama. This is especially for working with  small LLMs and building LoRAs.

```bash
curl -L https://github.com/frinknet/gelli/raw/main/install.sh | sh
```

just install and itwill do the rest...
